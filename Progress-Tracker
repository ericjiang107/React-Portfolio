Day 1: Added routes to react project -- messed around with styling

Day 2: Added About Me section utilizing timeline

Day 3: Updated nav bar and center image. Added projects into project section followed by attached link to their respectivie Github repositories. 
Added form for contacting and updated the navigation bar. Issues surfaced when rendering images for cardMedia under material-ui. 

Day 4: Fixed image rendering in Projects section, added additional images and links. Updated background with an image. Set up database
using Firestore. Updated functionality for navbar and fixed the links so that they open on a new tab. 

Day 5: Added sticky to the navbar so it stays on the top followed by a scroll back to top page option. Recieving errors such as: TypeError:
cannot read property 'style' of null, etc. 

Day 6: Added scrollup bar feature. Fixed TypeError (first fix: using console.log -- fixed error to a point. second fix: reformatted the 
code for the bar). The scrollup bar still needs a bit of styling update but the overall functionality works. Debugged code for troubleshooting.
Found out there were mild style changes that impacted the scrollup bar. Will continue to debug. 

Day 7: Updated Home page with proper background image. Added Scroll to top component and fixed navigation in home page. Updated About Me page 
with fixed navigation images, background color and updated about me section with new text as well as resume link button.
